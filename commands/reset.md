# The reset command


> We have already used the reset command to match the buffer zone and the selected commit (HEAD commit was used in the previous lesson).
When a commit reference is given (ie, a branch, hash, or tag name), the reset command will:
1. Overwrite the current branch so it will point to the correct commit
2. Optionally reset the buffer zone so it will comply with the specified commit
3. Optionally reset the working directory so it will match the specified commit
